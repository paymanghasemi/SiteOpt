\usage{
First_Objective_Import(Address, Sheet = "First_Objective",
                              Sense= "Min", Silence = FALSE, Env= .GlobalEnv)
}
\arguments{
\item{Address}{A string: the location and name of the excel file.}

\item{Sheet}{A string: the name of the sheet holding the first objective's data. (Default: "First_Objective")}

\item{Sense}{A string: "Min" means the objective is to be minimized and "Max" means the objective is to be maximized. (Default: "Min")}

\item{Silence}{A binary parameter: if \code{FALSE}, the function will report a summary message. If \code{TRUE}, the function will be silent.  (Default: FALSE)}

\item{Env}{the environment where the package should create or access variables.
By default the package works in the R's Global environment. (Default: .GlobalEnv)}
}
\value{
NULL (creates some variables in the environment but returns nothing)
}
\description{
\code{First_Objective_Import} imports the problem's first objective coefficients from a sheet in an excel file.\cr
It creates a list named \code{First_Objective}, where \code{First_Objective[["Coefficients"]]} stores the coefficients of parcels
and \code{First_Objective[["Sense"]]} is equal to "Min" or "Max" showing if the objective is to be minimized or maximized.\cr
This function is not sensitive to the order the parcels are stored in the sheet and will automatically store parcels
in \code{First_Objective[["Coefficients"]]} sorted with the same order they were stored in \code{Parcels}.\cr
\strong{Note:} The coefficients of the parcels not included in the excel file will be considered zero.
}
\details{
The first row of the sheet will be ignored as captions. The first column of the sheet should include names, and the second column should include coefficients.\cr
Here is an example First Objective table:

\if{html}{\figure{Objective1.jpg}{}}
\if{latex}{\figure{Objective1.jpg}{options: width=2.0in}}\cr

\strong{Note:} The coefficients of the parcels not appearing in the excel file will be equal to zero.
