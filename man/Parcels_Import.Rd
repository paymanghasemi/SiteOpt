\title{Import parcel status data from Excel file}
\usage{
Parcels_Import(Address, Sheet= "Parcels", Silence= FALSE, Env= .GlobalEnv)
}
\arguments{
\item{Address}{A string: the location and name of the excel file.}

\item{Sheet}{A string: the name of the sheet holding the parcels' data.
(Default: "Parcels")}

\item{Silence}{A binary parameter: if \code{FALSE}, the function will report a
summary message. If \code{TRUE}, the function will be silent.  (Default: FALSE)}

\item{Env}{the environment where the package should create or access variables.
By default the package works in the R's Global environment. (Default: .GlobalEnv)}
}
\value{
NULL (creates some variables in the environment but returns nothing)
}
\description{
\code{Parcels_Import} imports the parcels' data from a sheet
in an excel file. It will create some variables  in the input \code{Env}.
The variables are \code{Parcels} storing the name of all parcels and the
order they are used, and \code{Status} storing the status of the parcels.\cr
\strong{Note:} These variables are essential to create
the optimization problem. So, if not created properly, using other functions will
result in an error.
}
\details{
In the input excel file, the first row of the sheet will be ignored as captions. The first column of
the sheet should include names of parcels, and the second column should include their status.
Value \bold{1} means the parcel is already protected (owned), and value
\bold{0} means the parcel is not protected (unowned). These values are
essential in creating optimization variables.\cr Here is an example table of a problem with 5 parcels:

\if{html}{\figure{Assignment.jpg}{Our logo}}
\if{latex}{\figure{Assignment.jpg}{options: width=2.0in}}\cr

In the optimization model, protected (owned) and unprotected (unowned) parcels
will be represented by the binary decision variables \code{(1-y)} and
\code{x}. In the final solution after optimization, \code{(1-y)=1} means that
the parcel which was initially protected (owned) remains protected, and
\code{(1-y)=0} means that the parcel is divested (sold).\cr Similarly, \code{x=1} means
that the parcel that was initially unprotected (unowned) will become protected (invested), and
\code{x=0} means that the parcel will remain unprotected.\cr (For more
information refer to the Paper)
